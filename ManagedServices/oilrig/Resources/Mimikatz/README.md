# Mimikatz

Mimikatz was used to list all available provider credentials using `sekurlsa::logonPasswords` and perform Pass-The-Hash via `sekurlsa::pth`.

For this scenario, no significant changes were made to the original functionality of Mimikatz.

Source code and pre-built Mimikatz can be downloaded from: <https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/>

## Dependencies

To build the binary with the following instructions, you will need the following dependencies downloaded and installed:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Windows Driver Developer Kit (WinDDK)](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=11800)

## Build Instructions

From the [mimikatz folder](/Enterprise/Resources/Mimikatz/mimikatz/), run the following command:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" mimikatz.sln /build release
```

The resulting executable will be found in the x64 folder created during the build process.

This executable should be renamed as `m64.exe` and should be copied to Resources/payloads/TwoFace.
