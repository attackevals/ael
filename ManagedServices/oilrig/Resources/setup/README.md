# OilRig Setup Procedure

## Emulation Team Infrastructure

1. **Linux Attack Platform**: Kali Linux 2019.2
2. **Mail and Apache Server**: Kali Linux 2019.2

## Emulation Team Infrastructure Configuration

This methodology assumes the following static IP address configurations:

| Red Team System | IP Address |
| ------ | ------ |
| Linux Attack Platform | 192.168.0.4 |
| Mail and Apache Server | 192.168.0.5 |

#### A note about red team payloads

- This evaluation utilizes payloads that model malware previously used by OilRig.
- These utilities include credential dumpers, implants, and file exfiltration.
- The [Binaries.zip](../Resources/Binaries/binaries.zip) contains all executables in one zip file for easy download. The password is `malware`.
  - Implants are configured to connect back to static IP address 192.168.0.4. Build instructions for each payload can be found with source code in their respective directories.

### Linux Attack Platform Setup \ 192.168.0.4

1. Download the OilRig ATTACK Evaluations Library to the `/opt/` directory
1. Use the Linux commands below to populate the binaries in the expected directories for the scenario:

    ```
    # from oilrig/
    unzip -P malware Resources/Binaries/binaries.zip

    # copy VALUEVAULT (b.exe) and TwoFace (contact.aspx) to the payload staging directory for SideTwist
    cp Resources/Binaries/b.exe Resources/payloads/SideTwist
    cp Resources/Binaries/contact.aspx Resources/payloads/SideTwist

    # copy RDAT.exe to the payload staging directory for TwoFace
    cp Resources/Binaries/RDAT.exe Resources/payloads/TwoFace
    ```

1. Download [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki) to the `Resources/payloads/TwoFace/` directory. Rename Mimikatz executable as `m64.exe`.
1. Download [Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to the `Resources/payloads/SideTwist/` directory
1. Download [PsExec.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) to the `Resources/payloads/TwoFace/` directory
1. Install [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP)

### Mail and File Server Setup \ 192.168.0.5

1. Install Apache
1. Install Postfix
1. Stage the SideTwist dropper `Marketing_Materials.zip` to /var/www/html
1. Run the [`install-configure-postfix.sh`](../../Resources/setup/install-configure-postfix.sh) bash script as sudo

    ```
    sudo ./install-configure-postfix.sh
    ```

1. Run the [`setup-apache-fileserver.sh`](../../Resources/setup/setup-apache-fileserver.sh) bash script as sudo

    ```
    sudo ./setup-apache-fileserver.sh

Note: You may need to chmod the scripts to allow them to run.

## Target Infrastructure

4 targets, all domain joined to the `boombox` domain:

1. *SQL Server* : tested and executed on CentOS 7.9

    .\modify-defender.ps1
    ```

1. Create the user accounts as used in the scenario:

    | username | groups |
    | ---------- | ----------|
    | tous | EWS Admins, SQL Admins, Domain Users |
    | gosta | EWS Admins, Domain Users |
    | mariam | Domain Users |
