# Scenario Infrastructure

We hope to capture the general structure of what is reported to have been seen being used by [OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/).

The requirements described herein should be considered a bare minimum to execute the scenario. If you have the time and resources to remain true-to-form, you may elect to stand up multiple of each of these servers, non-contiguous IP space, etc. If you are not concerned with emulating [OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/) to this degree, this level of effort is not necessary. You could for instance, phish, serve payload, and exfil from/to the same server.

## Resources

The [Binaries.zip](./Resources/Binaries/binaries.zip) contains all executables in one zip file for easy download. The password is `malware`.

This scenario also utilizes `Mimikatz`, `Plink` and `PsExec` as payloads:

- [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki)
- [Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
- [PsExec.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)

## Emulation Team Infrastructure

1. **Linux Attack Platform**: Kali Linux 2019.2
2. **Mail and File Server**: Kali Linux 2019.2

## Emulation Team Infrastructure Configuration

This methodology assumes the following static IP address configurations:

| Red Team System | IP Address |
| ------ | ------ |
| Linux Attack Platform | 192.168.0.4 |
| Mail and Apache Server | 192.168.0.5 |

#### A note about red team payloads

- This evaluation utilizes payloads that model malware previously used by OilRig.
- These utilities include credential dumpers, implants, and file exfiltration.
- The [Binaries.zip](../Resources/Binaries/binaries.zip) contains all executables in one zip file for easy download. The password is `malware`.
  - Implants are configured to connect back to static IP address 192.168.0.4. Build instructions for each payload can be found with source code in their respective directories.

### Linux Attack Platform Setup \ 192.168.0.4

1. Download the OilRig ATTACK Evaluations Library to the `/opt/` directory
1. Use the Linux commands below to populate the binaries in the expected directories for the scenario:

    # copy VALUEVAULT (b.exe) and TwoFace (contact.aspx) to the payload staging directory for SideTwist
    cp Resources/Binaries/b.exe Resources/payloads/SideTwist
    cp Resources/Binaries/contact.aspx Resources/payloads/SideTwist

    # copy RDAT.exe to the payload staging directory for TwoFace
    cp Resources/Binaries/RDAT.exe Resources/payloads/TwoFace
    ```
1. Download [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki) to the `Resources/payloads/TwoFace/` directory. Rename Mimikatz executable as `m64.exe`.
1. Download [Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to the `Resources/payloads/SideTwist/` directory
1. Download [PsExec.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) to the `Resources/payloads/TwoFace/` directory
