Based on open-source intelligence, the MITRE ATT&CK&reg; Evaluations team created the menuPass scenario leveraging techniques seen in the wild. The scenario was built based on tools, intelligence, and resources available at the time.

## Adversary Overview üêº
Active since at least 2006, [menuPass](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/) (aka APT10) is a threat group believed to be sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). 
The group has focused on the exfiltration of sensitive data in support of Chinese national security objectives. 
menuPass has targeted the aerospace, construction, engineering, government, and telecommunications sectors primarily in the US, Europe, Japan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. 
The group is known for orchestrating [Operation Cloud Hopper](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-uk-operation-cloud-hopper-report-april-2017.pdf), a global espionage campaign discovered in 2016 and 2017 that involved the sustained exploitation of MSPs.
In December 2018, the US DOJ filed [criminal charges](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) against two menuPass members in connection to the group‚Äôs activities.

MSS-affiliated groups such as menuPass have demonstrated a pattern of exploiting targets on a much broader geographic scope than the groups sponsored by the People Liberation Army (PLA), and are believed to be more likely to target the United States and regions outside of China‚Äôs direct sphere of influence. menuPass is known specifically for its use of living-off-the-land techniques, leveraging custom malware, utilizing fileless and anti-analysis tactics for defense evasion, and exploiting trusted third-party relationships for credential access.
