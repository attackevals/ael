# ATT&CK Evaluations Library Overview

The ATT&CK Emulation Library includes a collection of adversary emulation plans used in published ATT&CK Evaluations.

Emulation plans are a comprehensive approach to emulating a specific adversary, e.g. Turla, from initial access
through exfiltration. The plans are organized by evaluation and threat actor, and are designed to emulate a real breach
from the designated adversary.

## Directory Structure

Each emulation plan focuses on a specific named threat actor. The README of each individual plan provides a curated
summary of available cyber threat intelligence, composed of an intelligence overview of the actor (describing who they
target, how, and why where possible) as well as the scope of their activity (i.e. breadth of techniques and malware
used). All presented information is cited back to relevant publicly available cyber threat intelligence and communicated
and annotated via ATT&CK.

Within each emulation plan, the operational flow provides a high-level summary of the captured scenario(s). These
scenarios will vary based on the adversary and available intelligence, but typically follow a sequential progression of
how the actor breaches then works towards achieving their operational objectives within a victim environment (espionage,
data/system destruction, etc.).

The content to execute the scenario(s) is broken down into step-by-step procedures provided in both human and
machine-readable formats. Scenarios can be executed end-to-end or as individual tests. The human-readable formats
provide additional relevant background where possible as well as any setup prerequisites, while the machine-readable
format is designed to be programmatically parsed (ex: read, reformatted, and ingested into an automated agent, such as
CALDERA and/or breach simulation frameworks).
