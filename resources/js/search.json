All presented information is cited back to relevant publicly available cyber threat intelligence and communicated and annotated via ATT&CK.","Within each emulation plan, the operational flow provides a high-level summary of the captured scenario(s).

Scenarios can be executed end-to-end or as individual tests.

APT29's objective over time and across a diverse target set appears to have been the exfiltration of information that could be used to inform strategic decision making. 1","Target Industries: APT29 operations have been directed against government agencies, embassies, political parties, defense contractors, non-governmental organizations, law enforcement, media, pharmaceutical companies, and think tanks. Geographically, APT29 has aggressed targets in the United States, Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Turkey, Uganda, Poland, Chechnya, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Czech Republic, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, Ireland, and Hungary. 1, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16","Operations: In terms of operational tradecraft, APT29 is distinguished by their commitment to stealth and use of sophisticated techniques. APT29 is reported to have exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and has pursued actions on the objective using suites of custom malware, coupled with alternate execution methods such as PowerShell and WMI. APT29 has also been known to employ various operational cadences (smash-and-grab vs. slow-and-deliberate) depending on the target's perceived intelligence value. 1","APT29 is reported to have attained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications ( T1190), phishing ( T1566.001, T1566.002), and supply chain compromise ( T1195). The group is reported to have implemented at least two operational cadences, smash-and-grab and slow-and-deliberate. Different suites of tools and TTPs were employed for each one of these cadences. If a target was determined to be of value, the attackers are reported to have modified TTPs, and deployed a stealthier toolset with the intent or establishing long-term persistent access. 1","The objective of smash-and-grab operations appears to have been rapid collection and exfiltration. 1 As such, soon after achieving an initial foothold, APT29 actors are reported to have performed host-based situational awareness checks, and immediately sought to collect and exfiltrate data. If the host was determined to be of value, a stealth toolkit was deployed and persisted. The attackers are reported to have moved through the network, exfiltrating data and persisting on hosts deemed to be valuable. 1","In their smaller more targeted campaigns, APT29 has utilized a different toolset incrementally modified to attempt to evade published intelligence about their operations. 1"]},{"i":"apt29-attck-navigator","l":"APT29 ATT&CK

The group tends to target Colombia-based institutions, including entities in the financial, manufacturing, and petroleum sectors. 2 However, this threat actor has also executed operations against victims throughout South America, Europe, the US, and Australia. 3 4 While Blind Eagle tends to be largely opportunistic in their motives, though they have conducted espionage operations as well. 5","Blind Eagle generally relies on commodity RATs, including Imminent Monitor, BitRAT, QuasarRAT, AsyncRAT, LimeRAT, and RemcosRAT. 6 7 8 This threat actor's campaigns often leverage spearphishing for initial access and the deployment of encrypted payloads. 2 Additional common TTPs used by this threat actor include: spearphishing, use of malicious macros, process injection, and other LOTL techniques. 5 9 The group also employs relatively strict targeting, and has been known to link-shortening services that geoloate victims. 3"]},{"l":"Group Overview Report References","p":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099/","https://blog.scilabs.mx/malware-campaign-attributed-to-apt-c-36-context-and-iocs-update-june-2022/","https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/02/blind-eagle-apt-c-36-targets-colombia","https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/","https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/","https://web.archive.org/web/20190625182633/https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/apt-c-36-continuous-attacks-targeting-colombian-government-institutions-and-corporations-en/","https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:DTTI-wdD7KcJ:blog.la.trendmicro.com/proyecto-rat-una-campana-de-spam-dirigida-a-entidades-colombianas-a-traves-del-servicio-de-correo-electronico-yopmail/cd=10hl=enct=clnkgl=us","https://www.ecucert.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alerta-APTs-2022-03-23.pdf","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html","ID","Report Links"]},{"i":"connect-with-us","l":"Connect with us \uD83D\uDDE8️","p":["We \uD83D\uDC96 feedback!

Geographically, Carbanak has compromised targets in over 30 countries, to include Russia, Germany, Ukraine, China, USA, Poland, Bulgaria, Brazil, Iceland, Spain, and more. 6","Operations: Carbanak is known for persistence and operational patience, waiting before executing illicit funds transfers during their campaigns. Carbanak has taken advantage of system users by launching spearphishing attacks in order to get their malware on target. Carbanak has abused the trust of digital signatures by creating a fake identity in order to obtain valid certificates from a certification authority (CA) 4 for their variant of the Anunak malware, which is also called Carbanak. 7 In addition to custom malware, Carbanak has been known to use administrative tools native to the Windows environment, including PowerShell, WMI, and RDP.","Carbanak is reported to begin most breaches with spearphishing ( T1566.001) and social engineering in order to get a legitimate user to download a Microsoft Word document with malicious files embedded in the document.

They are also known to host malicious files on Google Docs and PasteBin ( T1101.002) 4 to further expand their command and control. Once on target, Carbanak has been found to rely on using valid accounts ( T1078) to perform most of their actions. 6 The group is known to move laterally and escalate their privileges across networks to find critical systems that manage financial transactions. 1 Carbanak has been found to target hosts that have specific banking software that would facilitate the illicit funds transfers. 6 The group is reported to then establish persistence using Windows native tools, such as scheduled tasks ( T1053.005) and auto-run services ( T1543.003), or other non-malicious tools, such as VNC ( T1021.005). 4, 8 From there, Carbanak is known to wait up to four months from initial access before stealing money, 5 using this time to expand access and gather instructions for how to initiate the

initiate infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe (T1218.005) to infect the victim. 25 This is a departure from previously established usage of weaponized Office macros (T1059.005)

Turla gains initial access through a spearphishing email, a fake software installer is downloaded onto the victim machine and execution of the EPIC payload takes place. Once persistence and C2 communications are established, a domain controller is discovered, and CARBON-DLL is ingress into victim network. Further lateral movement takes the attackers to a Linux Apache server, PENGUIN is copied to the server and used to install a watering hole.","Phase 1: The scenario begins when the user Gunter visiting a typosquat domain via a spearphishing email. When the link is opened, a fake software installer is downloaded on Gunter’s Windows host machine. Gunter clicks “Install,” executing the malicious EPIC payload. EPIC establishes persistence and connects to a C2 server via a proxy web server using HTTP requests. The attacker’s enumeration on Gunter’s device, discovers a domain controller on the network and the domain admin Frieda.","Phase 2: To maintain persistence, the attackers will deploy CARBON-DLL and prepare to laterally move onto the domain controller. The use of password spraying helps to obtain Frieda’s domain admin credentials. Frieda’s credentials are then used to mount the DC’s hard drive, move a copy of CARBON-DLL to this drive, and execute the malware on the DC via remote scheduled task. A Linux Apache Server and the server’s admin Adalwolfa is discovered during enumeration. CARBON-DLL downloads Mimikatz and dumps Adalwolfa’s stored NTLM hash. Mimikatz and Adalwolfa’s NTLM hash are used to perform a pass-the-hash (PtH) attack allowing the attackers to authenticate into Adalwolfa’s device and copy CARBON-DLL to the workstation via PsExec.","Phase 3: On Adalwolfa’s workstation, a custom keylogger is dropped and captures plaintext SSH credentials. CARBON-DLL downloads the PENQUIN malware to Adalwolfa’s workstation, the SSH credentials allows the attackers to copy PENQUIN to the Apache server and execute the malware via plink.

CTI deviation: Based on available reporting, PENQUINx64 has not been used in watering hole attacks. However, Turla has used other tools/payloads to launch watering hole attacks to fingerprint victims for initial access purposes. This scenario uses the installation of watering holes to transition into the SNAKE scenario (second scenario). Watering hole details: 1. User visits the compromised webpage hosting malicious Javascript. 2. On the user’s first visit, the browser adds and evercookie which has an MD5 value provided by the web server. The evercookie will keep track of which users have already visited the site. 3. On a user’s second visit, the stored MD5 value is used to identify the victim and the attackers will collect OS info which is sent to the C2 through POST requests.","After obtaining the NTLM hash for user Adalwolfa, the attackers will move laterally to this user’s workstation. In order to do this, the threat actor will leverage the CARBON-DLL implant on the domain controller to download PsExec and another copy of the CARBON-DLL installer. To perform the lateral movement, CARBON-DLL performs a pass-the-hash (PtH) attack to move the installer onto Adalwolfa’s device.

Emails with JPG attachments containing AES encrypted commands embedded using stegonagraphy are sent from the C2 server to the domain. LightNeuron's transport agent processes all emails via LightNeuron's companion DLL, which executes the embedded command and blocks delivery of the email from the C2 server. LightNeuron automatically collects all emails with recipients matching nk.local in a log file( C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\msmdat.xml).Eventually, LightNeuron is tasked to exfiltrate the email log, which is exfiltrated over the existing C2 channel.","User Egle on WIN10 workstation ( 10.100.40.103) Azuolas visits a legitimate, but compromised website nato-int.com.

The Snake installer will escalate privileges to SYSTEM by exploiting a Windows 10 vulnerability. Once running as SYSTEM, the installer will disable DSE by loading and exploiting a vulnerable driver. Once DSE is disabled, the installer will load the Snake rootkit driver. The rootkit driver will hook various functions and will inject a user-mode DLL into a SYSTEM process to execute received tasks from the C2 server. The driver will then wait for a browser process to make a network request to inject the user-mode DLL into the browser for C2 communications over HTTP. The injected DLLs will communicate between each other via named pipes. At some point, Egle will browse to a website, triggering the rootkit driver to inject the user-mode DLL into the browser process - this DLL will begin communication with the C2 server over HTTP.","Using this information, Snake impersonates the EgleAdmin account to run PsExec and execute another copy of the Snake rootkit installer on the file server, berzas.

This way, when your handler package gets imported, the C2 server will know that your handler is available and where to reach it. You will also need to use a struct to represent your handler, as your handler will need to implement the util.Handler interface. The below code provides an example:","Note that we use a factory method to return our struct - this gives us more flexibility if we need to add more variables to our handler struct, and it allows easier handler creation in unit tests.","util.AvailableHandlers maps handler names ( string) to handler structs that implement the util.Handler interface. This means that our new handler must implement the util.Handler interface:","Since each handler may operate differently, we leave it up to the handler creaters to determine how to start and stop their handlers. The only requirements are the method signatures - both methods must return error if something goes wrong, and StartHandler must take in a string(the REST API server address) and a config.HandlerConfigEntry, which represents the handler config entry for our specific handler. You will not need to call these methods outside of your unit tests - main.go will handle that for you when starting up enabled C2 handlers.","For our HTTP handler, we can use StartHandler to listen on the address specified in our configuration entry (which we will create momentarily) and to serve URL paths of our choice.

We can do this by adding a new import statement in handler/handlers.go(change your package name accordingly):","The _ underscore in front of the import means that we're only importing the package for its side effects, in particular the init function. Remember that the init function is what stores our handler struct in the map of available handlers. handlers.go will not directly reference individual C2 handlers, so we can't use a typical import."]},{"l":"Config Entry","p":["config/handler_config.yml contains the configuration entries for all of the available handlers in the C2 server.

The only one that is required is the enabled setting, since this tells the C2 server whether or not to run the handler.","When creating your own handler, think about what configuration settings it will need. If the C2 traffic will be over HTTP, perhaps you want to allow users to specify the host/port combination to listen on.","In this guide, we'll use an HTTP C2 handler as a basic example, and we'll call it examplehttphandler.

Once injected, the user module will either communicate with the C2 server or execute tasks, depending on its mode of operation. The mode of operation is determined by what process the module is injected into - if injected into a browser process, the module will run in C2 communication mode. Otherwise, it will run in task execution mode.","The DLL runs via its DllMain function and branches off into either C2 communication mode or task execution mode, depending on the name of the injected process. The following process names will trigger C2 communication mode:","chrome.exe","firefox.exe","msedge.exe","iexplore.exe","All other process names will trigger task execution mode.","For full functionality, the module must be injected into a browser process and non-browser process. This will allow communication with the C2 server as well as actual command execution. The two module modes communicate with each other via named pipes. Specifically, the C2 communication module listens on \\\\.\\pipe\\commsecdev for beacon requests and task output from the task execution module, and the task execution module listens on \\\\.\\pipe\\commctrldev for instructions passed on by the C2 communication module.","The task execution module will periodically send beacon requests to the C2 communications module, which will forward the requests to the C2 server and send back the instruction response. If the instruction is to download or upload files, the C2 communications module will handle that directly without intervention from the task execution module. If the instruction is to execute a process or command, the execution module will run the task and send the output to the C2 communications module to forward to the C2 server.","Turla has used a similar user module DLL architecture in the past where they broke functionality apart into a pipe server and pipe client module, where the pipe server would handle communications with the C2 server and the pipe client would handle other tasks like command execution 1."]},{"l":"C2 Communications","p":["The user module communicates with a hardcoded C2 server and port value via HTTP GET/POST requests. To determine whether or not the server is online, the module will perform a heartbeat check by requesting the /PUB/home.html file. The server must respond with 1 to indicate that it is online.","Turla has used heartbeat URLs like /D/pub.txt and /IMAGE/pub.html 1","After successful heartbeat verification, the module will perform GET requests on /PUB/{implant_id}(e.g. GET /PUB/123456 to perform beacons and receive instructions. Some instructions may require the implant to run processes or execute shell commands, and the output will uploaded to the C2 server via POST requests to /IMAGES/3/{instruction_id}(e.g. POST /IMAGES/3/123456789012345678 to upload the command output for instruction 123456789012345678).","Note that while Turla has uploaded collected log files to its C2 server by sending POST requests to URLs like /IMAGE/2/{random numbers} 1, we opted to have the implant automatically send the output to the server to improve operator usability (i.e. not having to manually request command output each time a command is run).","When instructed to download a payload, the module will send a GET request to /IMAGES/3/{instruction ID}, using the instruction ID for the associated instruction. If the instruction ID matches a tasked instruction on the server side, the payload will be delivered, and the module will save it on disk at the specified location.","When instructed to upload an arbitrary file, the module will send a POST request to /IMAGES/3/{instruction ID}, using the instruction ID for the associated instruction. If the instruction ID matches a tasked instruction for non-command-output file uploads on the server side, the C2 server will accept the upload and save it server-side. Note that the endpoint is the same as for command output uploads - the C2 server distinguishes upload types based on the instruction ID used in the URL.","The implant can also be instructed to upload its log files via POST requests 1 to /IMAGES/3/{log file ID}, where the log file IDs are hardcoded ID strings for each log type:","62810421015953103444 for C2 logs","23329841273669992682 for execution logs","59463656487865612747 for pipe server (C2 communications module) logs","16488587954892310865 for pipe client (task execution module) logs","The implant will delete the log files after upload to clear them out 1."]},{"l":"Implant ID","p":["Prior to beginning C2 communications, the comms module mode will look up the local victim's computer name and use the first 10 characters as an XOR key against the default key value of 2157108421.

The material here will be expanded in the future."]},{"l":"Overview","p":["Any action you perform on a system is a detectable risk, especially when abusing functionality in \"weird\"/unintended ways. Rubeus (like any attacker toolset) can be detected in a number of methods, either from the host, network, or domain perspectives. I have a workmate who is fond of stating \"everything is stealthy until someone is looking for it\"- tools and techniques generally evade detection because either a) people are not sufficiently aware of the tool/technique and therefore not even looking, b) people can not collect and process the data needed at the appropriate scale, or c) the tool/technique blends with existing behavior to sufficiently sneak in with false positives in an environment. There is much more information on these steps and detection subversion in general in Matt Graeber and Lee Christensen’s Black Hat USA 2018 “Subverting Sysmon” talk and associated whitepaper.","From the host perspective, Rubeus can be caught during initial weaponization of the code itself, by an abnormal (non-lsass.exe) process issuing raw Kerberos port 88 traffic, through the use of sensitive APIs like LsaCallAuthenticationPackage(), or by abnormal tickets being present on the host (e.g. rc4_hmac use in tickets in a modern environment).","From a network or domain controller log perspective, since Rubeus implements many parts of the normal Kerberos protocol, the main detection method involves the use of rc4_hmac in Kerberos exchanges. Modern Windows domains (functional level 2008 and above) use AES encryption by default in normal Kerberos exchanges (with a few exceptions like inter-realm trust tickets). Using a rc4_hmac (NTLM) hash is used in a Kerberos exchange instead of a aes256_cts_hmac_sha1 (or aes128) key results in some signal that is detectable at the host level, network level (if Kerberos traffic is parsed), and domain controller event log level, sometimes known as \"encryption downgrade\"."]},{"l":"Weaponization","p":["One common way attack tools are detected is through the weaponization vector for the code. If Rubeus is run through PowerShell(this includes Empire) the standard PowerShell V5 protections all apply (deep script block logging, AMSI, etc.). If Rubeus is executed as a binary on disk, standard AV signature detection comes into play (part of why we do not release compiled versions of Rubeus, as brittle signatures are silly ; ). If Rubeus is used as a library then it's susceptible to whatever method the primary tool uses to get running. And if Rubeus is run through unmanaged assembly execution (like Cobalt Strike's execute_assembly) cross-process code injection is performed and the CLR is loaded into a potentially non-.NET process, though this signal is present for the execution of any .NET code using this method.","Also, AMSI (the Antimalware Scan Interface) has been added to .NET 4.8. Ryan Cobb has additional details on the offensive implications of this in the Defense section of his “Entering a Covenant: .NET Command and Control” post."]},{"i":"example-credential-extraction","l":"Example: Credential Extraction","p":["Say we have elevated access on a machine and want to extract user credentials for reuse.","Mimikatz is the swiss army knife of credential extraction, with multiple options. The sekurlsa::logonpasswords command will open up a read handle to LSASS, enumerate logon sessions present on the system, walk the default authentication packages for each logon session, and extract any reverseable password/credential material present. Sidenote: the sekurlsa::ekeys command will enumerate ALL key types present for the Kerberos package.","Rubeus doesn't have any code to touch LSASS (and none is intended), so its functionality is limited to extracting Kerberos tickets through use of the LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() API. From a non-elevated standpoint, the session keys for TGTs are not returned (by default) so only service tickets extracted will be usable (the tgtdeleg command uses a Kekeo trick to get a usable TGT for the current user). If in a high-integrity context, a GetSystem equivalent utilizing token duplication is run to elevate to SYSTEM, and a fake logon application is registered with the LsaRegisterLogonProcess() API call. This allows for privileged enumeration and extraction of all tickets currently registered with LSA on the system, resulting in base64 encoded .kirbi's being output for later reuse.","Mimikatz can perform the same base64 .kirbi extraction with the following series of commands:","Mimikatz can also carve tickets directly out of LSASS' memory with:","As \"everything is stealthy until someone is looking for it\", it's arguable whether LSASS manipulation or ticket extraction via the LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() API call is more \"stealthy\". Due to Mimikatz' popularity, opening up a handle to LSASS and reading/writing its memory has become a big target for EDR detection and/or prevention. However, LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() is used by a fairly limited set of processes, and creating a fake logon application with LsaRegisterLogonProcess() is also fairly anomalous behavior. However full API level introspection and baselining appears to be a more difficult technical problem than LSASS protection."]},{"i":"example-over-pass-the-hash","l":"Example: Over-pass-the-hash","p":["Say we recover a user's rc4_hmac hash (NTLM) and want to reuse this credential to compromise an additional machine where the user account has privileged access.","Sidenote: pass-the-hash != over-pass-the-hash. The traditional pass-the-hash technique involves reusing a hash through the NTLMv1/NTLMv2 protocol, which doesn't touch Kerberos at all. The over-pass-the-hash approach was developed by Benjamin Delpy and Skip Duckwall(see their \"Abusing Microsoft Kerberos - Sorry you guys don't get it\" presentation for more information). This approach turns a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a fully-fledged ticket-granting-ticket (TGT).","Let's compare \"over-passing-the-hash\" via Mimikatz' sekurlsa::pth command verus using the asktgt command from Rubeus (or Kekeo if you'd like).","When sekurlsa::pth is used to over-pass-the-hash, Mimikatz first creates a new logon type 9 process with dummy credentials - this creates a new \"sacrificial\" logon session that doesn't interact with the current logon session. It then opens the LSASS process with the ability to write to process memory, and the supplied hash/key is then patched into the appropriate section for the associated logon session (in this case, the \"sacrificial\" logon session that was started). This causes the normal Kerberos authentication process to kick off as normal as if the user had normally logged on, turning the supplied hash into a fully-fledged TGT.","When Rubeus' asktgt command is run (or Kekeo's equivalent), the raw Kerberos protocol is used to request a TGT, which is then applied to the current logon session if the /ptt flag is passed.","With the Mimikatz approach, administrative rights are needed as you are manipulating LSASS memory directly. As previously mentioned, Mimikatz' popularity has also led to this type of behavior (opening up a handle to LSASS and reading/writing its memory) being a big target for EDR detection and/or prevention. With the Rubeus/Kekeo approach, administrative rights are not needed as LSASS is not being touched. However, if the ticket is applied to the current logon session (with /ptt), the TGT for the current logon session will be overwritten. This behavior can be avoided (with administrative access) by using the /createnetonly command to create a sacrificial process/logon session, then using /ptt /ticket:X /luid:0xa.. with the newly created process LUID. If using Cobalt Strike, using the make_token command with dummy credentials and then kerberos_ticket_use with the ticket retrieved by Rubeus will let you apply the new TGT in a way that a) doesn't need administrative rights and b) doesn't stomp on the current logon session TGT.","It is our opinion that the LSASS manipulation approach is more likely (at the current moment) to be detected or mitigated due to the popularity of the technique. However the Rubeus approach does result in another piece of detectable behavior. Kerberos traffic to port 88 should normally only originate from lsass.exe - sending raw traffic of this type from an abnormal process could be detectable if the information can be gathered.","Sidenote: one way both approaches can potentially be caught is the previously mentioned \"encryption downgrade\" detection. To retrieve AES keys, use Mimikatz' sekurlsa::ekeys module to return ALL Kerberos encryption keys (same with lsadump::dcsync) which are better to use when trying to evade some detections."]},{"l":"Ticket requests and renewals","p":["Breakdown of the ticket request commands:","Command","Description","asktgt","Request a ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) from a hash/key or password","asktgs","Request a service ticket from a passed TGT","renew","Renew (or autorenew) a TGT or service ticket","brute","Perform a Kerberos-based password bruteforcing attack"]},{"l":"asktgt","p":["The asktgt action will build raw AS-REQ (TGT request) traffic for the specified user and encryption key (/rc4, /aes128, /aes256, or /des).

Constrained delegation is complex. For more information see this post or Elad Shamir's \"Wagging the Dog\" post.","A TL;DR explanation is that an account with constrained delegation enabled is allowed to request tickets to itself as any user, in a process known as S4U2self. In order for an account to be allowed to do this, it has to have TrustedToAuthForDelegation enabled in it's useraccountcontrol property, something that only elevated users can modify by default. This ticket has the FORWARDABLE flag set by default. The service can then use this specially requested ticket to request a service ticket to any service principal name (SPN) specified in the account's msds-allowedtodelegateto field. So long story short, if you have control of an account with TrustedToAuthForDelegation set and a value in msds-allowedtodelegateto, you can pretend to be any user in the domain to the SPNs set in the account's msds-allowedtodelegateto field.","This \"control\" can be the hash of the account (/rc4 or /aes256), or an existing TGT (/ticket:X) for the account with a msds-allowedtodelegateto value set. If a /user and rc4/aes256 hash is supplied, the s4u module performs an asktgt action first, using the returned ticket for the steps following. If a TGT /ticket:X is supplied, that TGT is used instead.","A /impersonateuser:X parameter MUST be supplied to the s4u module. If nothing else is supplied, just the S4U2self process is executed, returning a forwardable ticket:","That forwardable ticket can then be used as a /tgs:Y parameter (base64 blob or .kirbi file) to execute the S4U2proxy process. A valid msds-allowedtodelegateto value for the account must be supplied (/msdsspn:X).

One or more alternate service names can be supplied, comma separated (/altservice:cifs,HOST,...).","Let's expand on the previous example, forging access to the filesystem on primary.testlab.local by abusing its constrained delegation configuration and the alternate service substitution. Let's package it all into one step as well, performing a TGT request, S4U2self process, S4U2proxy execution, and injection of the final ticket:","By default, several differences exists between the S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy TGS-REQ's generated by Rubeus and genuine requests.

Firstly, the library you wish to inject must be written into the address space of the target process (Herein referred to as the host process). Secondly the library must be loaded into that host process in such a way that the library's run time expectations are met, such as resolving its imports or relocating it to a suitable location in memory.","Assuming we have code execution in the host process and the library we wish to inject has been written into an arbitrary location of memory in the host process, Reflective DLL Injection works as follows.","Execution is passed, either via CreateRemoteThread() or a tiny bootstrap shellcode, to the library's ReflectiveLoader function which is an exported function found in the library's export table.","As the library's image will currently exists in an arbitrary location in memory the ReflectiveLoader will first calculate its own image's current location in memory so as to be able to parse its own headers for use later on.","The ReflectiveLoader will then parse the host processes kernel32.dll export table in order to calculate the addresses of three functions required by the loader, namely LoadLibraryA, GetProcAddress and VirtualAlloc.","The ReflectiveLoader will now allocate a continuous region of memory into which it will proceed to load its own image. The location is not important as the loader will correctly relocate the image later on.","The library's headers and sections are loaded into their new locations in memory.","The ReflectiveLoader will then process the newly loaded copy of its image's import table, loading any additional library's and resolving their respective imported function addresses.","The ReflectiveLoader will then process the newly loaded copy of its image's relocation table.","The ReflectiveLoader will then call its newly loaded image's entry point function, DllMain with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.

Wizard Spider uses the initial access provided through Emotet to deploy their TrickBot malware to gain access to the Domain Controllers. Once access is obtained to the Domain controllers, the Ryuk ransomware is deployed. Characteristics of this campaign include an accelerated timeline, sloppy code, and focus for obtaining control over the Domain Controllers as fast as possible in order to deploy Ryuk.","Phase 1 Wizard Spider uses a phishing campaign to send a malicious document with embedded macros document that the initial access victim, Dorothy, downloads and enables. The macros download and execute Emotet, deploys multiple download links to ensure delivery, and establishes C2 over port 8080. Emotet gains persistence by modifying a registry key and downloads an Outlook scraper to collect Outlook contacts message threads and credentials. Emotet laterally moves via RDP using the credentials, and downloads Trickbot.","Phase 2 TrickBot communicates back to the C2 server over HTTP, and Wizard Spider performs extensive network and system discovery. Wizard Spider conducts privilege escalation with kerberosting using Rubeus. Domain controller access is obtained by RDP’ing using harvested credentials, and ensuring persistence with a registry key that executes TrickBot with user sign-in. Wizard Spider uses AdFind to map active directory for network reconnaissance.","Phase 3 Using RDP connections to the compromised Domain Controller and wbadmin msc console, Wizard Spider uses a batch script to stop and kill all backup services and processes. Once completed, Ryuk is executed throughout the environment, starting with the backup servers. Ryuk executes automated privilege elevation and defense evasion, and encrypts files recursively."]},{"l":"Scenario Steps","p":["\uD83D\uDC63 Steps start at 01 to follow emulation procedures","Dorothy inadvertently activates a weaponized Emotet Microsoft Office document masquerading as a benign Word document attached to a phishing email. After enabling the macros in Word, the VBscript embedded in the document generates a PowerShell script using the Document_Open() event. The PowerShell script downloads the initial DLL binary as a loader invoked with base64 encoded data, and multiple download links are used to ensure that the initial loader is delivered. The malicious DLL establishes a C2 session with the adversary control server over port 8080. Analyst Note: the document is pre-positioned in the environment. We do not emulate sending the document to target, as our focus is evaluating their product against post-initial-access TTPs.","Emotet","Emotet takes steps to gain persistence in the victim environment by modifying a registry key using the RegSetValueExA WinAPI function.","Employing vssadmin, the adversary copies the active directory database as a volume shadow copy, ntds.dit, and exfiltrates the shadow copy using an RDP-mounted network share.","Enumerating local processes, Emotet also uses WinAPI functions and downloads an Outlook scraper DLL from C2. Executing the Outlook scraper in process memory, PowerShell is used to collect emails and contacts from the client, including credentials from another user, bill@oz.local.","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0102/ https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/timelining-grim-spiders-big-game-hunting-tactics/","https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/ExploringEmotetsActivities_Final.pdf https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/evolution-emotet-trojan-distributor https://www.picussecurity.com/blog/the-christmas-card-you-never-wanted-a-new-wave-of-emotet-is-back-to-wreak-havoc.html https://www.carbonblack.com/2019/04/24/cb-tau-threat-intelligence-notification-emotet-utilizing-wmi-to-launch-powershell-encoded-code/ https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/return-of-emotet.html","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emotet-command-and-control/ https://global.ahnlab.com/global/upload/download/asecreport/ASEC%20REPORT_vol.88_ENG.pdf https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/ms-isac-security-primer-emotet/ https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/ https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a#:~:text=TrickBot%20uses%20HTTPS%20to%20communicate,logic%20and%20various%20configuration%20files.text=TrickBot%20downloads%20several%20additional%20files%20and%20saves%20them%20to%20the%20victim https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/timelining-grim-spiders-big-game-hunting-tactics/ https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/ https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/a-nasty-trick-from-credential-theft-malware-to-business-disruption.html https://redcanary.com/blog/how-one-hospital-thwarted-a-ryuk-ransomware-outbreak/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/ https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/a-nasty-trick-from-credential-theft-malware-to-business-disruption.html","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/ https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/ https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/ https://n1ght-w0lf.github.io/malware%20analysis/ryuk-ransomware/","https://www.cynet.com/attack-techniques-hands-on/emotet-vs-trump-deep-dive-analysis-of-a-killer-info-stealer/ https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/evolution-emotet-trojan-distributor https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A https://www.picussecurity.com/blog/the-christmas-card-you-never-wanted-a-new-wave-of-emotet-is-back-to-wreak-havoc.html","https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html","https://www.securityartwork.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trickbot-report-S2-Grupo.pdf https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TrickBot-Now-Offers-TrickBoot-Persist-Brick-Profit.pdf https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/2016/10/trickbot-we-missed-you-dyre https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module/ https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware","Leveraging Bill’s credentials located during the email scraping, Emotet RDPs into the Toto host.

The discovery of kimeramon, a bastion workstation, makes way for the affiliate to access the corporate subsidiary network through trusted access ( Step 1-2 of Bastion Host Diagram). Next the affiliate downloads ADRecon.ps1, and uses it for discovery on Active Directory and the corporate network. The ADRecon output contains information about a backup server datamon, Linux KVM server leomon and server administrators ( Step 3 of Bastion Host Diagram).","Next, the affiliate discovers SQL Server Management Studio installed on kimeramon and uses BITSAdmin.exe to download InfoStealer then executes InfoStealer against kimeramon to obtain plaintext credentials for the backup admin account ( Step 4 of Bastion Host Diagram). The compromised credentials are used to access the backup server and execute InfoStealer against the NetBNMBackup server datamon( Step 3 of SQL Server Diagram). The decrypted output contains the plaintext passwords for: the workstation local administrator account windesk, Linux KVM server administrator account marakawa, and the domain admin account ykaida.da. Using windesk, the affiliate utilizes several methods in an attempt to disable anti-virus and EDR solutions on the bastion host.","The affiliate utilizes windesk credentials and the RDP session on kimeramon to edit the registry and enable WDigest. The affiliate then dumps credentials via Task Manager and exfiltrates the dump file using rclone( Step 5 of Bastion Host Diagram).","The compromised domain admin account ykaida.da is used to download ExMatter and a network scanning script to identify additional targets via PowerShell ( Step 6-7 of Bastion Host Diagram). The affiliate uses PsExec to execute ExMatter against the identified targets to exfiltrate data. After remote execution of ExMatter, the affiliate executes ExMatter on the local workstation.","The affiliate downloads ALPHV BlackCat Ransomware (Linux) to kimeramon, uses SCP to copy ALPHV BlackCat Ransomware (Linux) to leomon and sends an SSH command to the Linux KVM server to execute ( Step 1-4 of Linux KVM Diagram).","Next, the affiliate downloads ALPHV BlackCat Ransomware (Windows) to kimeramon( Step 8 of Bastion Host Diagram) and provides the Domain Admin credentials to run the executable with administrative privileges.

The only requirements are the method signatures - both methods must return error if something goes wrong, and StartHandler must take in a string(the REST API server address) and a config.HandlerConfigEntry, which represents the handler config entry for our specific handler. You will not need to call these methods outside of your unit tests - main.go will handle that for you when starting up enabled C2 handlers.","For our HTTP handler, we can use StartHandler to listen on the address specified in our configuration entry (which we will create momentarily) and to serve URL paths of our choice. Feel free to reference other handler implementations to get an idea of how you can set up your C2 handler. StopHandler will take care of gracefully tearing down the handler components."]},{"l":"Register Our C2 Handler","p":["There are two steps for registering our C2 handler - creating a configuration entry and making sure our handler package gets imported."]},{"l":"Import Handler","p":["In order for the C2 server executable to incorporate our new handler code, we need to import the package so that the init function in our handler source code runs. We can do this by adding a new import statement in handler/handlers.go(change your package name accordingly):","The _ underscore in front of the import means that we're only importing the package for its side effects, in particular the init function. Remember that the init function is what stores our handler struct in the map of available handlers. handlers.go will not directly reference individual C2 handlers, so we can't use a typical import."]},{"l":"Config Entry","p":["The handler configuration YAML file contains the configuration entries for all of the available handlers in the C2 server. Each entry is a dictionary that maps the handler name to an inner dictionary that maps a configuration setting name to its value.","For example:","In the above example, the handler name is myhandler, and there are three configuration settings:","host- the IP address that the handler should bind to when listening for C2 traffic","port- the port that the handler should listen on","enabled: whether or not the handler should run when the C2 server starts up.","Since different handlers can use different protocols and methods for handling C2 traffic, you may see that some handlers have different settings in their config entries. The only one that is required is the enabled setting, since this tells the C2 server whether or not to run the handler.","When creating your own handler, think about what configuration settings it will need. If the C2 traffic will be over HTTP, perhaps you want to allow users to specify the host/port combination to listen on.","In this guide, we'll use an HTTP C2 handler as a basic example, and we'll call it examplehttphandler. Our config file entry will look as follows:","Note that we set enabled to true so that our handler will start up when the server is run. We'll simply create a file ./config/my_example_handler_config.yml and write those contents in it."]},{"l":"Unit Tests","p":["Don't forget your unit tests!

The threat actor will then drop the multi-stage loader malware SigLoader, which loads the first payload, FYAnti( Step 2-3 of IIS Server Diagram). FYAnti will then execute the open-source RAT, QuasarRAT, on the server ( Step 4 of IIS Server Diagram). QuasarRAT checks for internet connectivity then connects to the C2 server and begins logging keystrokes ( Step 5 of IIS Server Diagram).","Once C2 communications have been established, the threat actor will leverage QuasarRAT to perform discovery on the IIS server. As a result, the adversary discovers a domain controller on Subsidiary A's network.","Next, menuPass observes user Kizumi logging into the IIS server. While she is working, Kizumi is prompted to enter her domain admin credentials, which will be captured by the adversary via QuasarRAT’s keylogger ( Step 5 of IIS Server Diagram).","To prepare to move laterally onto the domain controller, the threat actor downloads a second copy of SigLoader, FYAnti, and QuasarRAT on the IIS server ( Step 1 of Domain Controller Diagram). By using PowerShell with Kizumi’s credentials, the threat actor moves the malware to the domain controller then creates and runs a scheduled task ( Step 2 of Domain Controller Diagram). This scheduled task is utilized to DLL sideload SigLoader and execute QuasarRAT on the domain controller. ( Step 2-3 of Domain Controller Diagram).","Once QuasarRAT establishes C2 communications on the domain controller, menuPass dumps credentials via NTDS and exfiltrates the output ( Step 4 of Domain Controller Diagram). The threat actor analyzes the dump offline to retrieve plaintext passwords for domain users. menuPass then conducts an internal port scan to search for open RDP and SMB ports on the network. As a result, the threat actor discovers the bastion workstation, which is located in Subsidiary B’s network with access to Subsidiary A’s network ( Step 5 of Domain Controller Diagram).","Next, menuPass uses QuasarRAT on the domain controller, which is running with domain administrator privileges, to download SigLoader and SodaMaster to the bastion workstation ( Step 1 of Bastion Host Diagram). The threat actor then remotely creates a service on the bastion workstation that will execute a legitimate binary to sideload SigLoader( Step 2 of Bastion Host Diagram).","The threat actor then executes the remotely created service which DLL sideloads SigLoader, which loads the SodaMaster payload ( Step 3 of Bastion Host Diagram). On execution, SodaMaster performs automated discovery, anti-sandbox checks, and modifies the host’s Windows Defender whitelist ( Steps 4-5 of Bastion Host Diagram). As a result, menuPass notices the presence of a file server on Subsidiary B’s network.","The threat actor then observes user Kmimi accessing the bastion host to perform tasks. Kmimi is a file server administrator on Subsidiary B’s network. To prepare to move laterally onto this server, the threat actor uses secretsdump to dump credentials from Security Account Manager (SAM), Local Security Authority (LSA), and cached domain credentials, which is cracked offline to retrieve Kmimi’s admin credentials ( Step 1 of File Server Diagram).","In order to pivot onto the file server, menuPass downloads WMIexec.vbs onto the bastion workstation ( Step 2 of File Server Diagram). menuPass then downloads WMIexec.vbs onto the workstation, and accesses the bastion workstation via RDP using Kmimi’s previously retrieved credentials to execute WMIexec.vbs, establishing a reverse shell to the file server ( Step 3 of File Server Diagram). Using the reverse shell, menuPass executes PowerShell to enumerate files( Step 4 of File Server Diagram). After the desired data has been found, the threat actor compresses the desired data via WinRAR and exfiltrates it via RoboCopy to an adversary controlled network share ( Steps 5-6 of File Server Diagram)."]}],[{"l":"menuPass Emulation Plans","p":["This directory contains the emulation plans for menuPass.","ℹ️ An emulation plan is the primary document used to execute the red team scenario during a purple team operation.","The scenario documents in the table below include the red team execution commands, links to source code, ATT&CK techniques leveraged, and CTI reporting pertaining to each scenario step.","Red Team Playbook","CTI Overview","Description","MSR2_menuPass_Scenario.md","menuPass CTI Overview","This contains the scenario developed to emulate TTPs of menuPass in Round 2 of ATT&CK Evaluations for Managed Services"]}],[{"l":"menuPass Scenario Overview"},{"i":"step-0---operator-setup","l":"Step 0 - Operator Setup"},{"i":"procedures","l":"☣️ Procedures","p":["Initiate an RDP session to the Windows jumpbox homelander (116.83.1.29)","Search for Command Prompt and right-click Run As Administrator.

This guide describes how developers can add a new handler to the C2 server.","In this guide, we'll use an HTTP C2 handler as a basic example, and we'll call it examplehttphandler."]},{"l":"Add Your Handler Source Code","p":["Within the handlers folder, create a new folder for your C2 handler.

This way, when your handler package gets imported, the C2 server will know that your handler is available and where to reach it. You will also need to use a struct to represent your handler, as your handler will need to implement the util.Handler interface. The below code provides an example:","Note that we use a factory method to return our struct - this gives us more flexibility if we need to add more variables to our handler struct, and it allows easier handler creation in unit tests.","util.AvailableHandlers maps handler names ( string) to handler structs that implement the util.Handler interface. This means that our new handler must implement the util.Handler interface:","Since each handler may operate differently, we leave it up to the handler creaters to determine how to start and stop their handlers. The only requirements are the method signatures - both methods must return error if something goes wrong, and StartHandler must take in a string(the REST API server address) and a config.HandlerConfigEntry, which represents the handler config entry for our specific handler. You will not need to call these methods outside of your unit tests - main.go will handle that for you when starting up enabled C2 handlers.","For our HTTP handler, we can use StartHandler to listen on the address specified in our configuration entry (which we will create momentarily) and to serve URL paths of our choice. Feel free to reference other handler implementations to get an idea of how you can set up your C2 handler. StopHandler will take care of gracefully tearing down the handler components."]},{"l":"Register Our C2 Handler","p":["There are two steps for registering our C2 handler - creating a configuration entry and making sure our handler package gets imported."]},{"l":"Import Handler","p":["In order for the C2 server executable to incorporate our new handler code, we need to import the package so that the init function in our handler source code runs. We can do this by adding a new import statement in handler/handlers.go(change your package name accordingly):","The _ underscore in front of the import means that we're only importing the package for its side effects, in particular the init function. Remember that the init function is what stores our handler struct in the map of available handlers. handlers.go will not directly reference individual C2 handlers, so we can't use a typical import."]},{"l":"Config Entry","p":["The handler configuration YAML file contains the configuration entries for all of the available handlers in the C2 server.

The only one that is required is the enabled setting, since this tells the C2 server whether or not to run the handler.","When creating your own handler, think about what configuration settings it will need. If the C2 traffic will be over HTTP, perhaps you want to allow users to specify the host/port combination to listen on.","In this guide, we'll use an HTTP C2 handler as a basic example, and we'll call it examplehttphandler.

If this is the first time that the SideTwist handler recognizes the implant with id {guid}, then it will set up a new session within the internal C2 REST server and then begin tasking the implant upon subsequent GET requests to the same endpoint.","For example:","As with other C2 handlers, implant tasking is performed by sending requests to the internal REST server using the evalsC2client.py script. The SideTwist handler will allow operators to task the following command types:","101 command arg1 arg2...- the command ID 101 will have the implant execute a shell command with the provided args. Note that a command is required for ID 101.","102 saveAsName|payloadName- the command ID 102 will have the implant request a payload specified by payloadName and save it as saveAsName.","WARNING: the handler does not validate the command structure or payload names/paths, so operators must ensure that the correct names and paths are used, the | character is correctly placed, etc.","103 fileToUpload- the command ID 103 will have the implant upload the specified local file to the C2 server.","104 command arg1 arg2...- the command ID 104 is an alias for command ID 101. Note that a command is required for ID 104.","105- instructs the implant to terminate.

The embedded string is placed within script HTML tags, e.g.:","Encryption and decryption are performed by XOR'ing the plaintext/ciphertext with the hardcoded key notmersenne. The underlying plaintext data is the task string that gets processed by the implant and is of the form commandNumber|commandID|base64(command to execute). For instance, the first task assigned to the implant may look something like 1|101|d2hvYW1pLmV4ZSAvYWxs(base64 encoding of whoami.exe /all), and the second task may look something like 2|102|YzpcdXNlcnNccHVibGljXHBheWxvYWQuZXhlfHBheWxvYWQuZXhl(base64 encoding of c:\\users\\public\\payload.exe|payload.exe).

Instead, the raw encrypted/encoded file data is returned.","SideTwist-specific payloads must be stored within the payloads/SideTwist directory within the parent directory of the control server. For instance, if the control server is being run from the Resources/control_server directory, the payloads must be placed in Resources/payloads/SideTwist/ in order for the SideTwist handler to successfully serve them."]},{"l":"File Uploads and Task Output","p":["When implants send task output or file uploads to the SideTwist C2 handler, they must do so by sending an HTTP POST request to /search/{guid} with their corresponding guid value. The server will not accept task output or file uploads from an implant if no task was assigned to the implant or if the specified task does not expect output (e.g. tasking the implant to terminate itself). The POST data must be a JSON dictionary with one key-value pair - the key is a string representation of the corresponding command number, and the value is a string containing the base64 encoding of the XOR-encrypted output or uploaded file data.","Example (implant abcd submits output thisismyoutput for command number 5):","Upon success, a successful HTTP response code is sent back with an empty response body.","For regular task output, the SideTwist handler will forward the decoded and decrypted output to the REST server. File uploads will be decoded and decrypted before being written to the server's file system.","Note that the file uploads themselves do not contain the file name to save as - this is determined by the handler when tasking the implant with command ID 104. For instance, if the implant is tasked with 104 C:\\path\\to\\file.txt, then the received file upload data will be saved as file.txt within the C2 server's files directory."]},{"l":"Bootstrap Tasking","p":["Since the SideTwist implant beacons back infrequently, the first beacon can be \"wasted\" since all it does is register a session without returning a command. If operators choose to do so, they can register \"bootstrap\" tasks, which will be the first task sent to any new session registered with the sidetwist handler. Note that only one bootstrap task can be registered for the SideTwist handler, and the task will only be sent on the implant's first beacon when registering a session. Subsequent beacons from the same implant will not return this task.","To set a bootstrap task, use the evalsC2client.py script accordingly:","In the example above, all new sidetwist sessions will be tasked with 101 whoami.exe/all.

In emulated execution, it only executes a single command at a time, waiting to again be called by a scheduled task. In the default execution, no arguments are required as the C2 address and port are hard-coded. This implementation contains optional arguments to make testing with it a little easier.","At a high level, the lifecycle of the implant consists of the following actions:","An additional file, update.xml, is required for execution. The implant checks the user's%LOCALAPPDATA%\\SystemFailureReporter folder and terminates if not found. The file does not need to contain anything. This is a small deviation from the CTI which used a relative path. Upon testing with scheduled tasks from the command line, it appears that the binary was being run from a different path and subsequently unable to follow the relative link. Without using an XP-compatible version of schtasks from the command line, the \"Start In\" variable seemingly cannot be set in CMD to allow for the use of relative paths."]},{"l":"Build","p":["The implant can be built in Visual Studio, with the Developer Command Prompt from VS, or with msbuild.exe which can be obtained separately from VS. Whichever option is chosen, ensure the file update.xml exists in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\SystemFailureReporter\\. For example, for user gosta, place the update.xml file in C:\\Users\\gosta\\AppData\\Local\\SystemFailureReporter. The file does not need to contain any data."]},{"l":"Developer Prompt","p":["Open a developer command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the solution file SideTwist.sln(it should be located in the same directory as the SideTwist and SideTwistTests code folders). Once there, run the following:","devenv.exe SideTwist.sln /build Release","The executable will be found in the release folder, typically located in .\\x64\\Release."]},{"l":"Run","p":["The program can be run without arguments to use the hard-coded values. These values are:","Without arguments, the implant will execute once and exit. To ease testing, additional arguments are available in the SideTwist-loopable.exe version (or by swapping out the main.cpp for the one found in SideTwist\\loopable_version). NOTE: This loopable version simply checks the local relative path for update.xml and will not work with scheduled tasks."]},{"l":"Note on Command Strings","p":["When issuing a command execution instruction (101 or 104), the default executor is CMD. Do not supply \"cmd /c\" as part of commands. For example, simply supply \"whoami\". Piping commands is acceptable. Note: CMD does not handle single quotes for paths.","All commands automatically redirect STDERR to STDOUT to capture errors.","For PowerShell, it is recommended you use Base64 encoded commands. Be sure to use the correct Base64 encoding (UTF-16LE). The command structure to the implant is as follows:","powershell -e base64goeshere","Do not include quotes, .exe, or cmd /c \"powershell.exe ...\".","If you have paths with spaces, recommend single quotes around the instruction with double quotes inside:","...

This means a live C2 server is required for some tests. Furthermore, the C2 server needs to be on the hard-coded C2 server (192.168.0.4).","The test for run() can be run with a live server and no instruction supplied (e.g. initial registration of the implant).","The FileDownload test needs the implant to have already been registered and a specific task waiting: ...

OilRig leverages spearphishing to gain initial access onto an administrator’s workstation and deploys their SideTwist malware. Once persistence is established on the victim network, the attackers will escalate privileges and move laterally onto an EWS server. Further enumeration of the EWS server will lead to OilRig’s identification of a SQL server storing confidential critical infrastructure data. Characteristics of this campaign include: custom webshells, Windows and Microsoft 365 exploitation, and key attacker objective on obtaining control of the SQL server to steal victim files. Phase 1: This scenario begins with the legitimate user Gosta downloading and opening a malicious Word document sent via spearphishing. When the document is first opened, the enabled macros will stealthily install the SideTwist backdoor on Gosta’s Windows host machine. SideTwist connects to a C2 server using GET & POST requests, with responses hidden in the source code of an NotFlickr page. After performing initial enumeration on Gosta’s device, OilRig discovers that the user is a member of the administrator group on an Exchange Web Server (EWS). Phase 2: The SideTwist backdoor harvests credentials and collects Gosta's password using VALUEVAULT, a credential theft tool. Using Gosta’s stolen EWS credentials, the attackers establish a remote connection to EWS via RDP tunneling. Once connected to the EWS, OilRig deploys the TwoFace webshell on the server to gain access to additional resources on the network. The use of TwoFace to perform enumeration on the EWS will lead attackers to discover a SQL server. Phase 3: Next, OilRig will use the TwoFace webshell to download Mimikatz and dump the credentials of targeted administrators on the EWS. Using the stolen credentials of Tous, an SQL admin, the adversary will perform pass-the-hash to move laterally onto the targeted SQL server. This signals the start of the data exfiltration phase. The attackers will gain persistent access to the database through the custom RDAT backdoor, copy the database backup files and exfiltrate them via the EWS API to an attacker-controlled mailbox.","Operations Flow Diagram","Software Flow Diagram"]},{"i":"scenario-steps","l":"Scenario Steps\uD83D\uDC63","p":["As the user Tous, OilRig uses the command prompt created by the Mimikatz pass the hash to perform discovery of the database backup files on the SQL server.
