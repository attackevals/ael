Hi Egle,
After our meeting earlier I spoke with Tenko about the SAP integration issue that was preventing the users from logging in. I did a little digging and noticed there is an authentication error on the SAP server.

When you get a few minutes could you check to make sure the service account is still active and the credentials have not expired? The account name is SVC_SAP2.
