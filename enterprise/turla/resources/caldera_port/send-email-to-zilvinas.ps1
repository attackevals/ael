Zilvinas,

I just checked on the service account. It appears that the account was still active, but the password had expired. I've adjusted the settings for the account, so the password should not expire again.

The new password is: dfsbH%T5RWf3bwq3aeGR$3%

Let me know if this fixes the authentication issue.
