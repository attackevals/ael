Based on open-source intelligence, the MITRE ATT&CK &reg; Evaluations team created the below scenario leveraging techniques seen from Turla in the wild. We have adapted the scenario based on tools and resources available at the time.

## Adversary Overview ‚ôæÔ∏èü™®üß∏

Active since at least the early 2000s, [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/) is a sophisticated Russian-based threat group that has infected victims in more than 50 countries.<sup>[1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-129a)</sup> The group has targeted government agencies, diplomatic missions, military groups, research and education facilities, critical infrastructure sectors, and media organizations.<sup>[1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-129a)</sup> <sup>[2](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-disruption-snake-malware-network-controlled)</sup>  [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/) leverages novel techniques and custom tooling and open-source tools to elude defenses and persist on target networks. <sup>[3](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/major-cyber-orgs-of-russian-intelligence-services.pdf)</sup> <sup>[4](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/18/2002197242/-1/-1/0/NSA_CSA_TURLA_20191021%20VER%203%20-%20COPY.PDF)</sup> The group is also known for its adaptability and willingness to evolve behaviors and tools to achieve campaign objectives. <sup>[5](https://www.eset.com/us/about/newsroom/press-releases/cyber-espionage-group-turla-and-its-latest-malware-under-the-microscope-1/)</sup> <sup>[6](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_apt-q1-2023-playbook-advanced-techniques-broader-horizons-and-new-targets)</sup> <sup>[7](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/Turla%20Neuron%20Malware%20Update.pdf)</sup>
[Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/) is known for their targeted intrusions and innovative stealth. After establishing a foothold and conducting victim enumeration, [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/) persists with a minimal footprint through in-memory or kernel implants. <sup>[8](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5213167)</sup> <sup>[9](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3603506)</sup> [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/) executes highly targeted campaigns aimed at exfiltrating sensitive information from Linux and Windows infrastructure.<sup>[10](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ESET_Turla_ComRAT.pdf)</sup> <sup>[11](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180251/Penquins_Moonlit_Maze_PDF_eng.pdf)</sup>

## Emulation Overview üìñ

This scenario follows Turla‚Äôs multi-phase intelligence collection campaign by establishing a typo-squatted website of NATO to target entities with a high value of information. During **phase one**, Turla implants a watering hole for persistence on the victim‚Äôs network as a way to compromise more targets of interest. Turla gains initial access through a spearphishing email, a fake software installer is downloaded onto the victim machine, and execution of the EPIC payload takes place. Once persistence and C2 communications are established, a domain controller is discovered, and CARBON-DLL is ingressed into victim network. Further lateral movement brings the attackers to a Linux Apache server where PENGUIN is copied to the server and used to install a watering hole.

In **phase two** of the attack, the attackers establish a typo-squatted website to target entities with high value information. The victims are prompted to update their (Not)Flash, and in doing so, EPIC is installed on their network. EPIC communicates to the C2 server via proxy web server with HTTPS requests, and SNAKE is then deployed to maintain foothold, elevate privileges and communicates to the C2 via HTTP/SMTP/DNS. Next, the attackers move laterally onto a Microsoft IIS server, install SNAKE, and create an admin account. The attackers then move laterally onto an Exchange workstation, and install SNAKE. Fianlly, they move laterally onto an Exchange Server and install LightNeuron. LIGHTNERON enables email collection and staging for exfiltrating stolen data via benign email PDF/JPG attachments. Turla proceeeds to collect and exfiltrate sensitive communications in an effort to identify new information sources and collect up-to-date information relevant to mission objectives.
