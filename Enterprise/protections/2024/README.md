# Ransomware Protections Micros

Based on open-source intelligence, the MITRE ATT&CK&reg; Evaluations team created
the ransomware protections micro emulations by leveraging common ransomware behaviors seen
in operations in the wild. The micros were designed based on tools, resources,
and intelligence available at the time.

## Threat Overview

Ransomware continues to be one of the most significant [global cybercriminal threats](https://www.dni.gov/files/CTIIC/documents/products/Worldwide_Ransomware_Activity_Oct_2022Sep_2023.pdf) across industry verticals. Ransomware operators, in response to [government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-convenes-third-global-gathering-to-counter-ransomware/) and [law enforcement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant) actions and evolving defensive capabilities, are continuously adjusting their activities within an ecosystem shaped by advancing technology and [Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware-as-a-service) models. The evolution to the more adaptable RaaS model reduces barriers to entry for malicious groups, eliminating the need for custom malware and enabling less experienced operators to successfully target organizations. This democratization of ransomware has fueled a [surge in ransomware attacks](https://www.corvusinsurance.com/blog/q4-ransomware-report) worldwide.

The Protections micro emulations focus on evaluating protection mechanisms against key ransomware behaviors in an assumed-compromise, micro-emulation format. The evaluated behaviors include:

- Enumeration and exfiltration of files
- Enumeration and encryption of files
- Propagation via automated host discovery and lateral movement

Each Protections micro is built to be stand-alone, with no dependencies on the success of a prior micro emulation.
