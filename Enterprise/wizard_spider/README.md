Based on open-source intelligence, the ATT&CK &reg; Evaluations team created the below scenario leveraging techniques seen from Wizard Spider in the wild. We have adapted the scenario based on tools and resources available at the time. 

## Adversary Overview ü™Ñ üï∏Ô∏è

Wizard Spider is a Russia-based e-crime group originally known for the Trickbot banking malware.<sup>[1]</sup> In August 2018, Wizard Spider¬†added¬†capabilities¬†to their Trickbot software enabling the deployment of the Ryuk ransomware.<sup>[2] [3] </sup> This resulted in "big game hunting" campaigns, focused on targeting large organizations for high-ransom return rates.<sup> [4] </sup>¬†Notable Ryuk attacks include the¬†Universal Healthcare System Hospitals,¬†US Georgia and Florida state government administrative offices, and¬†Chinese companies.<sup> [5] [6]</sup>

According to the¬†FBI, in less than one year¬†(2019-2020)¬†Wizard Spider extorted $61 million¬†USD from ransomware attacks.<sup> [7] [8]</sup> Throughout the operations, the group used a multi-staged¬†approach to manage ransomware campaigns.<sup>[9]</sup> Prior to encrypting a victim's network, the group exfiltrates sensitive data and threatens to publicly disclose it if the victim refuses to pay the ransom.
