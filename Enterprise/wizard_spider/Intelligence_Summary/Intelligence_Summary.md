## Adversary Overview 🪄 🕸️

Wizard Spider is a Russia-based e-crime group originally known for the Trickbot banking malware.<sup>[1]</sup> In August 2018, Wizard Spider added capabilities to their Trickbot software enabling the deployment of the Ryuk ransomware.<sup>[2] [3] </sup> This resulted in "big game hunting" campaigns, focused on targeting large organizations for high-ransom return rates.<sup> [4] </sup> Notable Ryuk attacks include the Universal Healthcare System Hospitals, US Georgia and Florida state government administrative offices, and Chinese companies.<sup> [5] [6]</sup>

According to the FBI, in less than one year (2019-2020) Wizard Spider extorted $61 million USD from ransomware attacks.<sup> [7] [8]</sup> Throughout the operations, the group used a multi-staged approach to manage ransomware campaigns.<sup>[9]</sup> Prior to encrypting a victim's network, the group exfiltrates sensitive data and threatens to publicly disclose it if the victim refuses to pay the ransom.
