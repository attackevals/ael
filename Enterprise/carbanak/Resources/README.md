# Resources

Please note that binary executable files hosted here have been added to password protected zip files.  The password for these files is "malware."

We provide a [script](/Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py) to automatically decrypt these files:

```
cd carbanak

python3 Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py -i ./ -p malware --decrypt
```

The Resources directory contains the following:

* Source code used for the components of the emulated attack
* Documentation on building source code and details on usage
* Backend components such as the control server
* Documentation for the environment setup

Each component has one or more additional documents specific to that resource.
