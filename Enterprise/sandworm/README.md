Based on open-source intelligence, the ATT&CK &reg; Evaluations team created the below scenario leveraging techniques seen from Sandworm in the wild. We have adapted the scenario based on tools and resources available at the time. 

## Adversary Overview üèúÔ∏è ü™±

Sandworm Team <sup>[1]</sup> is a destructive threat group attributed to Russia's General Staff of the Armed Forces, Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) that has been reportedly active since 2009.<sup>[2] [3]</sup>
In 2015 Sandworm used a BlackEnergy variant and the KillDisk module against three Ukrainian power distribution companies causing a power outage during the Christmas holidays. The outage left over 225,000 Ukrainian citizens without power in the middle of winter.<sup>[4]</sup> Sandworm is known for conducting large scale, well funded, destructive, and aggressive campaigns such as Olympic Destroyer, CrashOverride/Industroyer, and NotPetya.<sup>[5] [6] [7] [8]</sup> NotPetya, a destructive worm-like wiper malware disguised as ransomware, resulted in a global infection that caused nearly $1 billion in losses to three victim organizations alone.<sup>[2] [9]</sup> The "Sandworm" name was derived from references to the novel Dune found throughout the malware code, initially used to attribute other pieces of malware to the adversary. <sup>[10]</sup>

# Quick Links
### For Engineers üßë‚Äçüíª

### Resources

The [Resources Folder](./Resources/) contains the emulated software source code. Executables are provided in password protected zip files located in the specified software folder.  The password is `malware`.

We provide a [script](./Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py) to automatically decrypt these files:

```
$ cd sandworm

$ python3 Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py -i ./ -p malware --decrypt
```
### YARA Rules

[YARA rules](./yara-rules) are provided to assist the community in researching, preventing, and detecting malware specimens used in this emulation plan.
