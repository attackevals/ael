# Adversary Overview üèúÔ∏è ü™±

Sandworm Team <sup>[1]</sup> is a destructive threat group attributed to Russia's General Staff of the Armed Forces, Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) that has been reportedly active since 2009.<sup>[2] [3]</sup>
In 2015 Sandworm used a BlackEnergy variant and the KillDisk module against three Ukrainian power distribution companies causing a power outage during the Christmas holidays. The outage left over 225,000 Ukrainian citizens without power in the middle of winter.<sup>[4]</sup> Sandworm is known for conducting large scale, well funded, destructive, and aggressive campaigns such as Olympic Destroyer, CrashOverride/Industroyer, and NotPetya.<sup>[5] [6] [7] [8]</sup> NotPetya, a destructive worm-like wiper malware disguised as ransomware, resulted in a global infection that caused nearly $1 billion in losses to three victim organizations alone.<sup>[2] [9]</sup> The "Sandworm" name was derived from references to the novel Dune found throughout the malware code, initially used to attribute other pieces of malware to the adversary. <sup>[10]</sup>

Associated Names: ELECTRUM, Telebots, IRON VIKING, BlackEnergy (Group), Quedagh, VOODOO BEAR
